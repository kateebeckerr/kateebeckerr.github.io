    "text": "With the increased use and advancements of Satellite Imagery and algorithms, researchers and citizen scientists can now monitor the impacts of human activities on our natural landscapes. Impacts include deforestation, urban expansion, overpopulation, pollution, extraction, and burning fossil fuels. Through the application of remote sensing techniques, spectral indices combined with specific spectral bands highlight various land cover characteristics, such as vegetation health, water content, and soil properties. In order to investigate land cover, this project will classify remotely sensed imagery into land cover classes through supervised and unsupervised approaches.

The structure of this tree is a hierarchy of binary decisions, where each node represents a decision based on the value of a particular feature, each branch represents an outcome of that decision, and each leaf node represents the final decision or the class label. Each dwecision rule has two outcomes based on a conditiona statement pertaining to vlaues in each spectral band. Training the decision tree works to create branches that separate the data into subsets that are homogeneous as possible with regard to the target variable (class label). Unfortunately, these should be used with cautious for small changes in the data can lead to different tree structures making them less suitable. The rpart() function needs to know the model formula and training data you would like to use.\n\n#Using rpart() function\n# establish model formula\nSB_formula &lt;- type ~ red + green + blue + NIR + SWIR1 + SWIR2\n\n# train decision tree, formula specifies the relationship between the variables, method = class because we're performing a classification, and the missing values are omitted from the data\nSB_decisiontree &lt;- rpart(formula = SB_formula,\n                          data = SB_training,\n                          method = \"class\",\n                          na.action = na.omit)\n\n# visual representation of the decision tree\nprp(SB_decisiontree)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entire image can now be applied to the decision tree and therefore apply a model to the data. The terra package includes a predict() function that allows a model to be applied to the data but the names of the layers need to match the column names of the predictors used to train the tree. As a result, the function will return a raster layer with integer values. The output here will correspond to the factors levels in the training data. This step can also help you understand the classes your decision tree model was trained on and subsequently used for classifying the pixels in the Landsat image.\n\n# classify image based on decision tree\nSB_classify &lt;- predict(landsat, SB_decisiontree, type = \"class\", na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# inspect level to understand the order of classes in prediction\nlevels(SB_training$type)\n\n[1] \"green_vegetation\" \"soil_dead_grass\"  \"urban\"            \"water\"           \n\n# This produces green_vegetation, soil_dead_grass, urban, and water levels \n\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(SB_classify) +\n  tm_raster(title = \"Landcover Type\") +\n   tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"), title = \"Land Cover Map\")\n\nstars object downsampled to 1611 by 620 cells.

Several species of animals have already been greatly impacted, including the Sonoran Pronghorn, Desert Tortoise, Cactus Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl, Sonora Tiger Salamander, and Border Cats such as Ocelots, Cougars, etc.. Along with land development, some other factors contributing to biodiversity loss include mining, population increase, urbanization, recreation, high per capita water consumption, water diversion, and animal agriculture.

The metadata for a STAC item includes core identifying information (such as id, geometry, bounding box, and date), and additional properties (for example, place of collection). In comparison, assets are links to the actual data of the item (for example, links to the spectral bands of a satellite image.) These identifiers are useful when trying to perform a more detailed catalog search such as using the following coordinates to specify a bounding box and find the relevant raster:\n[-112.826843,

Area that has been lost with a BII of at least 0.75 or greater signifies an extreme biodiversity loss and is therefore used as a threshold in this analysis.\n\n\nCode\n#set threshold\nbi_threshold = 0.75\n\n#found the areas in which the BII was greater than 0.75\nabove_thresh_2017 = ph_2017 &gt;= bi_threshold \nabove_thresh_2020 = ph_2020 &gt;= bi_threshold \n\n#casted it as int. data array to accecss binary values \nabove_thresh_2017 = above_thresh_2017.astype(int) \nabove_thresh_2020 = above_thresh_2020.astype(int) \n\n#calculating the the total number of pixels in the phoenix subdivision for 2017 and 2020 \ntotal_2017 = np.sum(ph_2017) \ntotal_2020 = np.sum(ph_2020) \n\n#calculating the percentage of pixels with a BII of at least 0.75\npercent_2017 = (np.sum(above_thresh_2017 / total_2017)) * 100  \npercent_2020 = (np.sum(above_thresh_2020 / total_2020)) * 100\n\n#check: look at new variable \n#percent_2017\n#percent_2020\n\n#identify the lost pixels \nlost_pixels = above_thresh_2017 - above_thresh_2020 \nprint(np.sum(lost_pixels))\n\n#print percentage values for 2017 and 2020 \nprint(f\"Percentage of area with BII &gt;= 0.75 in 2017: {percent_2017:.2f}%\")\nprint(f\"Percentage of area with BII &gt;= 0.75 in 2020 {percent_2020:.2f}%\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to perform geospatial operations, it’s crucial to ensure that two spatial datasets are aligned in terms of their coordinate reference systems (CRS) and spatial extent. This alignment is necessary for accurate spatial analysis and overlays between vector and raster data.\n\n\nCode\n#make crs' the same \nphoenix = phoenix.to_crs(lost_pixels.rio.crs)\n\n#check to make sure crs' match\nphoenix.crs == lost_pixels.rio.crs\n\n#clipping the bii data to phoenix geometry \nlost_pixels = lost_pixels.rio.clip(phoenix.geometry, phoenix.crs) \n\n#clipping the ph_2020 data to phoenix geometry \nph_2020 = ph_2020.rio.clip(phoenix.geometry, phoenix.crs)\n\n#check\n#type(lost_pixels)\n#type(phoenix)\n#type(above_thresh_2017)\n\n\n/Users/katebecker/anaconda3/envs/mpc-env/lib/python3.11/site-packages/xarray/core/duck_array_ops.py:201: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in cast\n  return data.astype(dtype, **kwargs)\n\n\n\n\nFor further analysis this step is necessary to effectively process raster data. This is done to clean up unnecessary information in the dataset, especially if you’re not performing analyses based on bands. Similarily, it simplifies the structure of the data, especially if you’re working with a single-band raster. This kind of data preprocessing is common in geospatial analysis workflows to ensure data consistency and relevance to the study area.\n\n\nCode\n# remove length 1 dimension (band)\nph_2020 = ph_2020.squeeze()\n\n# remove coordinates associated to band\nph_2020 = ph_2020.drop('band')\n\n#clipping the ph_2020 data to phoenix geometry \nph_2020 = ph_2020.rio.clip(phoenix.geometry, phoenix.crs)\n\n#check: plot the area showing BII &gt; 0.75 \nlost_pixels.plot() \n\n\n/Users/katebecker/anaconda3/envs/mpc-env/lib/python3.11/site-packages/xarray/plot/utils.py:245: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute\n  vlim = max(abs(vmin - center), abs(vmax - center))\n\n\n&lt;matplotlib.collections.QuadMesh at 0x1bae660d0&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to effectively complete this analysis and create a meaningful and insightful map, all of the relevant data must be compiled together.\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))\nax.axis('off')\n\nphoenix.plot(ax=ax) #plot phoenix shapefile \nph_2020.plot(ax=ax) #plot 2020 raster\nlost_pixels.where(lost_pixels == 1).plot(ax=ax,  add_colorbar=False) #plotting the area with BII &gt;= 0.75 in 2017 that was lost by 2020\n\n\nplt.title('Maricopa County with Areas of Extreme Biodiversity Loss') #added a title \n\nplt.show() #printed map \n\n\n#get rid of bar on left \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that the data processing is over we can plot the phoenix shapefile, the 2020 raster, and the raster containing the biodiversity loss from 2017 to 2020. It appears that there was a significant loss in biodiversity within Maricopa County as a result of land development. The areas with a neon yellow hue are those with BII&gt;=0.75 in 2017 that were lost by 2020. Over a three year period, this loss is catastrophic for such a small temporal scale. This analysis can be further explored to measure biodiversity levels as climate change and human encroachment continues."
