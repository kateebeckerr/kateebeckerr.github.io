    "text": "Using the Microsoft Planetary Computer, 2017 and 2020 rasters of Phoenix subdivision are employed to study biodiversity loss in Maricopa County. In 2021, Maricopa County was the US county that added the most developed land since 2001. Several species of animals have already been greatly impacted, including the Sonoran Pronghorn, Desert Tortoise, Cactus Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl, Sonora Tiger Salamander, and Border Cats such as Ocelots, Cougars, etc.. Along with land development, some other factors contributing to biodiversity loss include mining, population increase, urbanization, recreation, high per capita water consumption, water diversion, and animal agriculture. In order to study the effects of human influence, the biodiversity intactness index (BII) is used to find changes in biodiversity from 2017 to 2020.\nGithub Repository: More information regarding the data, this analysis, and workflow can be found within this github repo. https://github.com/kateebeckerr/biodiversity_index_phoenix.git\n\n\nIn order to perform this analysis, several libraries and functions must be imported to work with geospatial data, particularly for accessing, processing, and visualizing raster and vector data. The Microsoft Planetary Computer must also be imported in order to access the STAC (Spatio Temporal Asset Catalog) and obtain the io-biodiversity collection.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport rioxarray as rioxr\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport contextily as ctx\nimport rasterio\nfrom rasterio.plot import show as rioshow\nfrom shapely.geometry import box\nimport xarray as xr\nimport matplotlib.patches as patches\n\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\nfrom scipy.ndimage import label\n\n# used to access STAC catalogs\nfrom pystac_client import Client\n# used to sign items from the MPC STAC catalog\nimport planetary_computer\n\n# ----- other libraries for nice ouputs\nfrom IPython.display import Image\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBII data: This dataset is part of the MPC STAC catalog.

The metadata for a STAC item includes core identifying information (such as id, geometry, bounding box, and date), and additional properties (for example, place of collection). In comparison, assets are links to the actual data of the item (for example, links to the spectral bands of a satellite image.) These identifiers are useful when trying to perform a more detailed catalog search such as using the following coordinates to specify a bounding box and find the relevant raster:\n[-112.826843,

Area that has been lost with a BII of at least 0.75 or greater signifies an extreme biodiversity loss and is therefore used as a threshold in this analysis.\n\n\nCode\n#set threshold\nbi_threshold = 0.75\n\n#found the areas in which the BII was greater than 0.75\nabove_thresh_2017 = ph_2017 &gt;= bi_threshold \nabove_thresh_2020 = ph_2020 &gt;= bi_threshold \n\n#casted it as int. data array to accecss binary values \nabove_thresh_2017 = above_thresh_2017.astype(int) \nabove_thresh_2020 = above_thresh_2020.astype(int) \n\n#calculating the the total number of pixels in the phoenix subdivision for 2017 and 2020 \ntotal_2017 = np.sum(ph_2017) \ntotal_2020 = np.sum(ph_2020) \n\n#calculating the percentage of pixels with a BII of at least 0.75\npercent_2017 = (np.sum(above_thresh_2017 / total_2017)) * 100  \npercent_2020 = (np.sum(above_thresh_2020 / total_2020)) * 100\n\n#check: look at new variable \n#percent_2017\n#percent_2020\n\n#identify the lost pixels \nlost_pixels = above_thresh_2017 - above_thresh_2020 \nprint(np.sum(lost_pixels))\n\n#print percentage values for 2017 and 2020 \nprint(f\"Percentage of area with BII &gt;= 0.75 in 2017: {percent_2017:.2f}%\")\nprint(f\"Percentage of area with BII &gt;= 0.75 in 2020 {percent_2020:.2f}%\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to perform geospatial operations, it’s crucial to ensure that two spatial datasets are aligned in terms of their coordinate reference systems (CRS) and spatial extent. This alignment is necessary for accurate spatial analysis and overlays between vector and raster data.\n\n\nCode\n#make crs' the same \nphoenix = phoenix.to_crs(lost_pixels.rio.crs)\n\n#check to make sure crs' match\nphoenix.crs == lost_pixels.rio.crs\n\n#clipping the bii data to phoenix geometry \nlost_pixels = lost_pixels.rio.clip(phoenix.geometry, phoenix.crs) \n\n#clipping the ph_2020 data to phoenix geometry \nph_2020 = ph_2020.rio.clip(phoenix.geometry, phoenix.crs)\n\n#check\n#type(lost_pixels)\n#type(phoenix)\n#type(above_thresh_2017)\n\n\n/Users/katebecker/anaconda3/envs/mpc-env/lib/python3.11/site-packages/xarray/core/duck_array_ops.py:201: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in cast\n  return data.astype(dtype, **kwargs)\n\n\n\n\nFor further analysis this step is necessary to effectively process raster data. This is done to clean up unnecessary information in the dataset, especially if you’re not performing analyses based on bands. Similarily, it simplifies the structure of the data, especially if you’re working with a single-band raster. This kind of data preprocessing is common in geospatial analysis workflows to ensure data consistency and relevance to the study area.\n\n\nCode\n# remove length 1 dimension (band)\nph_2020 = ph_2020.squeeze()\n\n# remove coordinates associated to band\nph_2020 = ph_2020.drop('band')\n\n#clipping the ph_2020 data to phoenix geometry \nph_2020 = ph_2020.rio.clip(phoenix.geometry, phoenix.crs)\n\n#check: plot the area showing BII &gt; 0.75 \nlost_pixels.plot() \n\n\n/Users/katebecker/anaconda3/envs/mpc-env/lib/python3.11/site-packages/xarray/plot/utils.py:245: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute\n  vlim = max(abs(vmin - center), abs(vmax - center))\n\n\n&lt;matplotlib.collections.QuadMesh at 0x1bae660d0&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to effectively complete this analysis and create a meaningful and insightful map, all of the relevant data must be compiled together.\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))\nax.axis('off')\n\nphoenix.plot(ax=ax) #plot phoenix shapefile \nph_2020.plot(ax=ax) #plot 2020 raster\nlost_pixels.where(lost_pixels == 1).plot(ax=ax,  add_colorbar=False) #plotting the area with BII &gt;= 0.75 in 2017 that was lost by 2020\n\n\nplt.title('Maricopa County with Areas of Extreme Biodiversity Loss') #added a title \n\nplt.show() #printed map \n\n\n#get rid of bar on left \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that the data processing is over we can plot the phoenix shapefile, the 2020 raster, and the raster containing the biodiversity loss from 2017 to 2020. It appears that there was a significant loss in biodiversity within Maricopa County as a result of land development. The areas with a neon yellow hue are those with BII&gt;=0.75 in 2017 that were lost by 2020. Over a three year period, this loss is catastrophic for such a small temporal scale. This analysis can be further explored to measure biodiversity levels as climate change and human encroachment continues."

In comparison, assets are links to the actual data of the item (for example, links to the spectral bands of a satellite image.) These identifiers are useful when trying to perform a more detailed catalog search such as using the following coordinates to specify a bounding box and find the relevant raster:\n[-112.826843,

The structure of this tree is a hierarchy of binary decisions, where each node represents a decision based on the value of a particular feature, each branch represents an outcome of that decision, and each leaf node represents the final decision or the class label. Each dwecision rule has two outcomes based on a conditiona statement pertaining to vlaues in each spectral band. Training the decision tree works to create branches that separate the data into subsets that are homogeneous as possible with regard to the target variable (class label). Unfortunately, these should be used with cautious for small changes in the data can lead to different tree structures making them less suitable. The rpart() function needs to know the model formula and training data you would like to use.\n\n#Using rpart() function\n# establish model formula\nSB_formula &lt;- type ~ red + green + blue + NIR + SWIR1 + SWIR2\n\n# train decision tree, formula specifies the relationship between the variables, method = class because we're performing a classification, and the missing values are omitted from the data\nSB_decisiontree &lt;- rpart(formula = SB_formula,\n                          data = SB_training,\n                          method = \"class\",\n                          na.action = na.omit)\n\n# visual representation of the decision tree\nprp(SB_decisiontree)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entire image can now be applied to the decision tree and therefore apply a model to the data. The terra package includes a predict() function that allows a model to be applied to the data but the names of the layers need to match the column names of the predictors used to train the tree. As a result, the function will return a raster layer with integer values. The output here will correspond to the factors levels in the training data. This step can also help you understand the classes your decision tree model was trained on and subsequently used for classifying the pixels in the Landsat image.\n\n# classify image based on decision tree\nSB_classify &lt;- predict(landsat, SB_decisiontree, type = \"class\", na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# inspect level to understand the order of classes in prediction\nlevels(SB_training$type)\n\n[1] \"green_vegetation\" \"soil_dead_grass\"  \"urban\"            \"water\"           \n\n# This produces green_vegetation, soil_dead_grass, urban, and water levels \n\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(SB_classify) +\n  tm_raster(title = \"Landcover Type\") +\n   tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"), title = \"Land Cover Map\")\n\nstars object downsampled to 1611 by 620 cells.

Impacts include deforestation, urban expansion, overpopulation, pollution, extraction, and burning fossil fuels. Through the application of remote sensing techniques, spectral indices combined with specific spectral bands highlight various land cover characteristics, such as vegetation health, water content, and soil properties. In order to investigate land cover, this project will classify remotely sensed imagery into land cover classes through supervised and unsupervised approaches. Supervised approaches use training data labeled by the user, whereas unsupervised approaches use algorithms to create groups which are identified by the user afterward.\nFor further data, workflow, and project information refer to this GitHub link: https://github.com/kateebeckerr/RemoteSensing_Landcover\nCredit: this lab is based on a materials developed by Chris Kibler"

    "text": "This analysis was conducted using data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as well as Landsat 8 satellite data to analyze trends and display the effects of the Thomas Fire that occurred on December 4th in 2017. The year of 2017 was comprised of multi-year droughts, high winds, and triple digit temperatures. Similarly, the prior winter, rain left a thick landscape of grass and brush that then dried over the record hot summer providing acres and acres of fuel. As a result, the Thomas Fire burned a total of 281,893 acres of land and resulted in an increased AQI categorized as unhealthy and hazardous in Santa Barbara and Ventura.\nFor further questions regarding the analysis, dataset, and workflow, the git hub link provided below will grant access to this\nGithub Repositorty: https://github.com/kateebeckerr/ThomasFire_Analysis.git\n\n\n\nDaily air quality index data from 2017 and 2018\n\n(https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/)\n(https://www.epa.gov)\n(https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data)\n\nA simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmosperically corrected surface reflectance data, collected by the Landsat 8 satellite\n\n(https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/landsat-c2-l2)\n\nA shapefile of fire perimeters in California during 2017\n\n(https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/CALFIRE-Forestry::california-fire-perimeters-all-1/about)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport pandas as pd \nimport rioxarray as rioxr\n\nfrom shapely.geometry import box\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\nfrom shapely.geometry import Point\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#Dataset 1\n#Read air quality data for the year of 2017 from the EPA website\n#The data is in a compressed ZIP file and is read in \naqi_2017 = pd.read_csv('https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/daily_aqi_by_county_2017.zip')\naqi_2017\n\n#Dataset 2\n#Read air quality data for the year of 2018 from the EPA website\n#The data is in a compressed ZIP file and is read in \naqi_2018 = pd.read_csv('https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/daily_aqi_by_county_2018.zip')\naqi_2018\n\n#Dataset 3\n#Reads the Landsat 8 satellite data for the data (2018-01-26) from a NetCDF file \n#Constructs a file path and places the .nc data within your current working directory and names landsat8 \nlandsat8 = os.path.join(os.getcwd(),'data/landsat8-2018-01-26-sb-simplified.nc')\nlandsat = rioxr.open_rasterio(landsat8) #Opens the raster data \nlandsat\n\n#Dataset 4\n#Reads the shapefile for California fire perimeters in 2017 from the file path in your working directory \ncalifornia = gpd.read_file('data/California_Fires/California_Fire_Perimeters_2017.shp')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly want to include the geometries associated with the Thomas Fire\n\n\nCode\n#filters the rows in the california dataframe where the fire_name column is equal to thomas and creates a new dataframe called thomas_Fire containing only the filtered rows  \nthomas_fire = california[california['FIRE_NAME'] == 'THOMAS']\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further analysis this step is necessary to effectively process raster data. This is done to clean up unnecessary information in the dataset, especially since the analysis is not based on bands. Similarily, it simplifies the structure of the data, especially when working with a single-band raster.

It’s also relevant to capture daily variations in order to analyze the overall trend in air quality levels over our time frame of interest.\n\n\nCode\n#five_day_average = aqi_sb.rolling('5D').mean() #rollign method is used to create a rolling view of the df with a specified window size, here it is a 5 day window (average of values in previous five days for corresponding date)  \naqi_sb['five_day_average'] = aqi_sb['aqi'].rolling('5D').mean() \n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to turn the landsat data into an image specific bands (red, green, blue) are selected from the Landsat dataset, converted into an xarray DataArray, and then visualized using matplotlib. The resulting plot will show a color representation of the Landsat image, where different colors correspond to different reflectance values in the selected bands.\nNote: (robust = TRUE) The (robust = TRUE) is important to include for it essentially trims a certain percentage of the highest and lowest pixel values before determining the color scale range. This trimming is done to exclude extreme values that might disproportionately affect the color scale.\n\n\nCode\n#transforming the geometries in the thomas_fire dataframe to a new crs specified by the landsat data \nthomas_fire = thomas_fire.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)\n\n#indexing the landsat variable to select the three bands red, green, and blue\n#converts the bands into an xarray data array and displays the true color image \nlandsat[[\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]].to_array().plot.imshow(robust = True)\n\n\n&lt;matplotlib.image.AxesImage at 0x1a8860e90&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis image selects the bands (SWIR2, NIR, Red), converting them into an xarray DataArray, and then visualizes the false image using matplotlib with robust scaling applied to enhance the visibility of features in the data. Using bands like Short-Wave Infrared 2 (SWIR2), Near-Infrared (NIR), and Red instead of Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) bands can provide advantages in remote sensing applications. Some common applications for the use of these bands is to dissect vegetation monitoring, water content and quality, mineral identification, urban studies ,and atmospheric penetration.\n\n\nCode\n#selects the three bands from the landsat 8 image which are swir22(short wave infrared), nir08(near-infrared), and red \n#converts the selected bands into an xarray dataarray and displays the false color image \nlandsat[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust = True)\n\n\n&lt;matplotlib.image.AxesImage at 0x1aa9b0bd0&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\naqi_sb = aqi_sb.reset_index() #removes the date from the current index to plot dates on the x axis \n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nax1 = aqi_sb.plot(x = 'date', \n        y =['aqi', 'five_day_average'],\n        title = 'Air Quality Index Since 2017 Thomas Fires',\n        xlabel='Date',\n        ylabel='Air Quality Index (AQI)',        \n        color = {'aqi':'#d73110',\n                 'five_day_average': '#56a4e8'\n                 }\n        )\n\nlandsat[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(ax=ax, robust = True) #plots a false color image using the landsat bands swir22, nir08, and red on the axis ax \nthomas_fire.plot(ax=ax, alpha=0.6, edgecolor = 'red', color = 'none')\n\n\n\n&lt;Axes: title={'center': 'spatial_ref = 0'}, xlabel='x coordinate of projection\\n[metre]', ylabel='y coordinate of projection\\n[metre]'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis was conducted to show the effects of the December 4th, 2017 Thomas Fire on the environmental conditions of Santa Barbara, California.

    "text": "Background\nWith rapid advancements in technology and increased attention to environmental problems, the future is data science. Design and use of environmental data infrastructure including software platforms, sensors, satellite data, mobile phone apps, and digitally generated visual representations is becoming inseparable to environmental solutions. In order to halt the perpetuation of historic marginalization and discrimination, the move towards data-driven approaches, in order to understand environmental processes, must include fair and equal access to data. The goal of this article is not to simply have a conversation regarding the importance of data but to highlight the ways in which countries across the globe have implemented policy, prioritized environmental governance, improved data infrastructure, and increased accountability. Four case studies will be dissected below to instill a sense of optimism in a growing data driven world.\n\n\nChina’s Environmental Disclosure Policy\nThree decades worth of rapid industrialization in China has become interwoven with environmental issues in which concerns have emerged regarding the long-term sustainability, social stability, and transparency deficits surrounding pollution problems. Given China’s decentralized government structure, environmental disclosures tend to be the weakest in the most polluted cities. Challenges surrounding transparency procedures include the prioritization of economic over environmental growth and the dissolving of policy as it moves through state channels . Fortunately, transparency regulations have become an increasingly popular tool globally and in 2008 China established a set of open environmental information measures requiring government agencies to divulge a plethora of environmental information to the public. This information has given birth to measures such as the use of NGO pollution databases by multinational companies, such as Nike and Walmert, to monitor Chinese suppliers exerting pressure to improve environmental practices. This has also taken shape in local governments in which they have positively responded to transparency indexes through open data sources. Accountability has also become a lead driver in change in which state and local governments regulate polluting enterprises by releasing the names of violators and requiring the disclosure of local governments. Through nongovernmental organizations, in the midst of an authoritarian government, China has set a standard for balancing continued economic transformation with better environmental management in order to prevent further pollution.\n\n\nEnvironmental Monitoring in Myanmar\nMyanmar is the host of an abundance of valuable natural resources such as land, teak, jade, rubies, oil, gas, and hydropower. The exploitation of these natural resources, in the midst of a political transition away from military ownership, has brought international attention to protecting Myanmar’s forests for their biodiversity, carbon sequestration, local livelihood and cultural value. The main concern has been the state’s approach to forest governance being dominated by a concern with timber extractions. In order to combat this, investigations have been underway to dissect how environmental monitoring seeks to make digital environmental data open and transparent and how that plays out in the forest sector. For years, satellite and internet based environmental data infrastructures have been used by states and scientists for several decades to survey land use activity, promote economic development, and bolster territorial claims. All of which resemble historic and present day colonialism trends elsewhere in the world. A step forward was in 2015 when the World Bank report argued the role of Open Data in ensuring environmental sustainability through transparent data that can help reduce pollution, conserve national resources, and build resilience to climate change”. The World Bank also pointed to solutions in which they highlighted government accountability, transparency, and citizen participation. As a result, Myanmar was able to construct a digital forest monitoring tool that now has the capacity to be monitored by international NGOs aimed at conservation, traders facilitating sustainable timber, and ethnic minority communities protecting their culture. The question of funding was also answered as international donors came together under programs that seek to foster good governance through data transparency.\n\n\nEuropean ‘No Net Loss’ Biodiversity Policies\nIn the 1970s, a conservation policy principle known as ‘No Net Loss’ (NNL) of biodiversity originated in the US and European environmental legislation. This policy proved to be a milestone in quantification, mitigation, and full compensation for negative biodiversity impacts associated with economic development and land use change. Further, these policies required the assessment of data availability for offset projects implemented under a NNL objective involving clear, up to date, and easily accessible data provided to stakeholders and the general public. As a result, NNL-type policies are now widespread, being applied to projects spread globally and increasingly adopted by the private sector. Like any environmental solution that results in real change, key barriers still exist such as the struggle for real data transparency as a result of perceived lack of necessity, lack of common protocols for collecting the data, and a lack of resources to do so. Unfortunately, when controversy arrived, the lack of readily available data on the implementation of NNL policy prevented any effort to make clear, empirical statements regarding the effectiveness of the policy which has also become a similar trend in environmental solutions. All that being said, with a focus on policy, Europe has become an active region for multinational environmental solutions and a key player in the fight for a nature against business-as-usual platform. Not only did this study unpack a successful strategy for combating the effects of climate change but it emphasized the importance of data transparency and accessibility from collection to analysis.\n\n\nData Transparency and the Mining Industry in Montana\nIn terms of data transparency, as frequently discussed above, this case study highlights one key difficulty in accessing data and that being the overall formatting of data. Once publicly accessible, data is frequently presented to the public as a PDF rather than a dataset and I’ve personally run into this problem before in which it makes analysis extremely difficult for the public to conduct citizen science. Citizen science, being another important component to environmental solutions in a data driven world, has grown substantially as a result of low cost technology and interfaces such as sensors and drones. This leads me to the state of Montana and the Stillwater Mining Company in which they were given access to expand platinum and palladium mining operations. This caused pause to concerned community members and the severe environmental effects that this would have on water quality and fisheries in the surrounding area. This gave birth to a monumental environmental act known as Good Neighbor Agreements. This gives community members a legally binding agreement to a company agreeing to full transparency regarding what is released into the surrounding air and water as a result of their operations. Further, they serve as an effective measure to reduce harmful industry behavior and empower community members to enact change through a better understanding of the contaminants and thresholds known to impact human or ecosystem health. This gave the people of Montana empowerment to sue the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and challenge the permit arguing that the expanded mining project would have severe impacts. As a result, the Stillwater Mining company agreed to maintain a publicly accessible electronic database of all historic data and all monitoring undertaken in compliance with state and federal environmental laws. This equal and fair access to big data enabled community members to practice citizen science and monitor chemical, physical, and biological patterns in their area. This is just one example of many that highlights the importance of public data accessibility and policy implementation.\n\n\nIn Summary\nAs discussed previously in this blog, three key barriers to real environmental change are the nature of policy, accountability, and the fair and equal access to data. The importance of policy can be highlighted when examining the two sides of outside interference. On one side stands politicians such as President Trump who release detrimental proposals such as the one in March of 2017 to cut 31% of the EPAs funding. On the other side, laws are implemented such as the Freedom of Information Act proposed to provide citizens with equal access to government collected pollution databases. These case studies also highlight the continued presence of colonialism in which the domination of military, economic, and political parties hinder the progress of effective innovation and big data initiatives to combat environmental injustices. Overall, as computing demand for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning grows, so do inequitable environmental consequences. Historical systemic injustices, the silencing of voices, the unequal balance of power, and the misrepresentation of data can be globally dismantled with the increased implementation of local changes across the globe. The future is data science and we must yield our power to create an ethical, just, and sustainable future.\n\n\nCitations\n\nTandfonline McCoy, J., & Somer, M. (2016).

    "text": "The overarching question of this analysis is “How have salmon fisheries in Alaska changed since 1985?”. In order to tackle this broad question, on a more finite scale, I asked: 1. What is the distribution of yearly fish yields for all five species of salmonoid? 2. How have nine of the most commercially important fisheries changed in terms of yearly catch? 3. Can we see clear trends in the time series data that can be accounted for by changes in Alaskan fisheries management?\nThe data used in this analysis was a publicly available data set provided by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The data set is composed of 9 variables: year, area, species name, number of fish(estimated), landed weight(lbs.), whole weight (lbs.), permit count, processor count, and vessel count. Although all variables are equally important, I modified my data set to only include year, species name, number of fish (estimated), and area in order to make R more computationally efficient. The data set is a .csv and was available through a report including harvest attributed to state managed fisheries, test fisheries, commercial sale o derby fish, and Annette Island fisheries. A better outline of the variables used in this analysis are listed below.\n\nYear: the year the landings occurred as recorded on ADF&G fish tickets\nArea: Areas define by groupings of statistical areas as recorded on ADF&G\nSpecies name: The species as recorded on ADF&G fish tickets\nNumber of fish (estimated): Number of animals is a count of each species in the catch or harvest.\n\nAnother data set was used in order to spatially map nine commercially important fisheries on top of a pre-existing Alaska shapefile. The shapefile was publicly available and provided by iGismap, an online data platform that provides GIS maps.\nDesign elements\nThis analysis required an exact approach and design\n\nGraphic form The graphic forms I used were a radar plot, a line chart, and a geo-spatial map. I wanted to explore more complex styles in this analysis, and I felt that the radar plot provided an aesthetically pleasing chart, one that resembled a sonar on a boat, for visualization of salmon catch by region in 1985 and 2023 to show change overtime. For the line graph I wanted to clearly show the distribution in salmon catch by year by species to create a visualization that included all components of my data set. I used this graph as my primary plot because I felt that any viewer of this info graphic would be able to gather the main takeaways of the analysis from a quick glance. Finally, I created a map to add a geographic context to show fisheries proximity to one another and locations in Alaska as well as provide the viewer with a non-complex visualization.\nText For most of my visuals I changed the aesthetics of the labels as well as the titles. I used limited text in most of my plots, except the line chart because I felt that the radar plot spoke for itself and would be crowded with excess information. A lot of information can be gathered from a radar plot with simply a categorical and numeric. For the map, I removed latitude and longitude values to make it look cleaner but included labels to clearly display the fisheries locations. Finally, the line chart included all text components except grid lines because I felt a viewer can still see clear patterns in the data set without minor and major lines. I also included all years on the x- axis for it to be an effective time series visualization.\nThemes I altered the theme elements pretty drastically in all three of my plots. This was necessary to have the text aesthetics, outlined above, that I wanted. Most theme elements included changes in legends, color bars, ticks, titles, the panel, and major and minor grid line.\nColors I used salmon themed color palettes found online and a light blue background to resemble water.\nTypography I used the same font for each visualization so that it would be cohesive in the infographic.\nGeneral design In my infographic, I let the visualizations speak for themselves by only including brief comments in order to tie the visualizations together with more background information. As stated above, I also centered and increased the size of my question and the line chart so that the viewer focuses their attention on the most important aspects and the main takeaways from this info graphic. I also used the same color scheme (salmon color hex codes) for the text and the visualizations\nContextualizing the data I was able to conceptualize the data by using the same time scale throughout all visualizations. I also stayed consistent with using number of fish (estimated) as the primary metric for fishery success.\nCentering your primary message I used my line graph as the center of my infographic and printed my primary question above it in order to highlight the main takeaway before a viewer dives deeper into the more complex visualizations.\nConsidering accessibility (e.g. colorblind-friendly palettes / contrast, alt text) I highlighted specific words in my infographic so that viewers can gather the main message by skimming the page rather than having to read through all of the text.\nApplying a DEI lens to your design Salmon fisheries are a major part of Alaska’s economy and have provided native tribes with food for the last century. Unfortunately, over fishing of Alaska salmon and other native fish, by international fishing companies, have diminished food resources as well as impacted historic cultural significance. Although this analysis was able to provide insight into the change in fisheries overtime, it doesn’t dissect the sustainability of these fisheries, who profits the most, who receives the majority of the catch, or how indigenous populations are affected. This is a primary analysis and can be greatly improved in terms of a DEI lens."
