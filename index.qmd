Welcome to my personal page, where I share my passion for data science and highlight my experience in the environmental field.

I am an Environmental Data Scientist passionate about leveraging data science and environmental research to drive sustainable solutions. Specializing in marine science, fisheries management, and sustainable food systems, I bring a unique blend of analytical skills and ecological expertise to tackle pressing environmental challenges.

I hold a Master’s in Environmental Data Science from UCSB’s Bren School and currently work as a Senior Research Assistant at the University of Queensland’s Ocean Conservation Lab. My research focuses on developing data-driven solutions to environmental issues, applying advanced statistical analysis, machine learning, and database creation. Specifically, I work on reducing bycatch in global artisanal fisheries and uncovering illegal endangered species trade—efforts aimed at influencing marine conservation policies and promoting sustainable seafood systems.

Our lab focuses on ocean zoning, protected areas, social equity in conservation, and sustainable seafood—bridging the gap between research and real-world impact.

With over three years of experience in marine and environmental science, I am committed to advancing sustainability through data-driven insights. Visit my website to explore my projects and learn more about my work.
