# Background

With rapid advancements in technology and increased attention to environmental problems, the future is data science. Design and use of environmental data infrastructure including software platforms, sensors, satellite data, mobile phone apps, and digitally generated visual representations is becoming inseparable to environmental solutions. In order to halt the perpetuation of historic marginalization and discrimination, the move towards data-driven approaches, in order to understand environmental processes, must include fair and equal access to data. The goal of this article is not to simply have a conversation regarding the importance of data but to highlight the ways in which countries across the globe have implemented policy, prioritized environmental governance, improved data infrastructure, and increased accountability. Four case studies will be dissected below to instill a sense of optimism in a growing data driven world.

# China's Environmental Disclosure Policy

Three decades worth of rapid industrialization in China has become interwoven with environmental issues in which concerns have emerged regarding the long-term sustainability, social stability, and transparency deficits surrounding pollution problems. Given China's decentralized government structure, environmental disclosures tend to be the weakest in the most polluted cities. Challenges surrounding transparency procedures include the prioritization of economic over environmental growth and the dissolving of policy as it moves through state channels . Fortunately, transparency regulations have become an increasingly popular tool globally and in 2008 China established a set of open environmental information measures requiring government agencies to divulge a plethora of environmental information to the public. This information has given birth to measures such as the use of NGO pollution databases by multinational companies, such as Nike and Walmert, to monitor Chinese suppliers exerting pressure to improve environmental practices. This has also taken shape in local governments in which they have positively responded to transparency indexes through open data sources. Accountability has also become a lead driver in change in which state and local governments regulate polluting enterprises by releasing the names of violators and requiring the disclosure of local governments. Through nongovernmental organizations, in the midst of an authoritarian government, China has set a standard for balancing continued economic transformation with better environmental management in order to prevent further pollution.

# Environmental Monitoring in Myanmar

Myanmar is the host of an abundance of valuable natural resources such as land, teak, jade, rubies, oil, gas, and hydropower. The exploitation of these natural resources, in the midst of a political transition away from military ownership, has brought international attention to protecting Myanmar's forests for their biodiversity, carbon sequestration, local livelihood and cultural value. The main concern has been the state's approach to forest governance being dominated by a concern with timber extractions. In order to combat this, investigations have been underway to dissect how environmental monitoring seeks to make digital environmental data open and transparent and how that plays out in the forest sector. For years, satellite and internet based environmental data infrastructures have been used by states and scientists for several decades to survey land use activity, promote economic development, and bolster territorial claims. All of which resemble historic and present day colonialism trends elsewhere in the world. A step forward was in 2015 when the World Bank report argued the role of Open Data in ensuring environmental sustainability through transparent data that can help reduce pollution, conserve national resources, and build resilience to climate change". The World Bank also pointed to solutions in which they highlighted government accountability, transparency, and citizen participation. As a result, Myanmar was able to construct a digital forest monitoring tool that now has the capacity to be monitored by international NGOs aimed at conservation, traders facilitating sustainable timber, and ethnic minority communities protecting their culture. The question of funding was also answered as international donors came together under programs that seek to foster good governance through data transparency.

# European 'No Net Loss' Biodiversity Policies

In the 1970s, a conservation policy principle known as 'No Net Loss' (NNL) of biodiversity originated in the US and European environmental legislation. This policy proved to be a milestone in quantification, mitigation, and full compensation for negative biodiversity impacts associated with economic development and land use change. Further, these policies required the assessment of data availability for offset projects implemented under a NNL objective involving clear, up to date, and easily accessible data provided to stakeholders and the general public. As a result, NNL-type policies are now widespread, being applied to projects spread globally and increasingly adopted by the private sector. Like any environmental solution that results in real change, key barriers still exist such as the struggle for real data transparency as a result of perceived lack of necessity, lack of common protocols for collecting the data, and a lack of resources to do so. Unfortunately, when controversy arrived, the lack of readily available data on the implementation of NNL policy prevented any effort to make clear, empirical statements regarding the effectiveness of the policy which has also become a similar trend in environmental solutions. All that being said, with a focus on policy, Europe has become an active region for multinational environmental solutions and a key player in the fight for a nature against business-as-usual platform. Not only did this study unpack a successful strategy for combating the effects of climate change but it emphasized the importance of data transparency and accessibility from collection to analysis.

# Data Transparency and the Mining Industry in Montana

In terms of data transparency, as frequently discussed above, this case study highlights one key difficulty in accessing data and that being the overall formatting of data. Once publicly accessible, data is frequently presented to the public as a PDF rather than a dataset and I've personally run into this problem before in which it makes analysis extremely difficult for the public to conduct citizen science. Citizen science, being another important component to environmental solutions in a data driven world, has grown substantially as a result of low cost technology and interfaces such as sensors and drones. This leads me to the state of Montana and the Stillwater Mining Company in which they were given access to expand platinum and palladium mining operations. This caused pause to concerned community members and the severe environmental effects that this would have on water quality and fisheries in the surrounding area. This gave birth to a monumental environmental act known as Good Neighbor Agreements. This gives community members a legally binding agreement to a company agreeing to full transparency regarding what is released into the surrounding air and water as a result of their operations. Further, they serve as an effective measure to reduce harmful industry behavior and empower community members to enact change through a better understanding of the contaminants and thresholds known to impact human or ecosystem health. This gave the people of Montana empowerment to sue the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and challenge the permit arguing that the expanded mining project would have severe impacts. As a result, the Stillwater Mining company agreed to maintain a publicly accessible electronic database of all historic data and all monitoring undertaken in compliance with state and federal environmental laws. This equal and fair access to big data enabled community members to practice citizen science and monitor chemical, physical, and biological patterns in their area. This is just one example of many that highlights the importance of public data accessibility and policy implementation.

# In Summary

As discussed previously in this blog, three key barriers to real environmental change are the nature of policy, accountability, and the fair and equal access to data. The importance of policy can be highlighted when examining the two sides of outside interference. On one side stands politicians such as President Trump who release detrimental proposals such as the one in March of 2017 to cut 31% of the EPAs funding. On the other side, laws are implemented such as the Freedom of Information Act proposed to provide citizens with equal access to government collected pollution databases. These case studies also highlight the continued presence of colonialism in which the domination of military, economic, and political parties hinder the progress of effective innovation and big data initiatives to combat environmental injustices. Overall, as computing demand for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning grows, so do inequitable environmental consequences. Historical systemic injustices, the silencing of voices, the unequal balance of power, and the misrepresentation of data can be globally dismantled with the increased implementation of local changes across the globe. The future is data science and we must yield our power to create an ethical, just, and sustainable future.
