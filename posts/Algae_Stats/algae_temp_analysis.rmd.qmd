# Does Seasonality Have an Effect on Pseudo-nitzschia Algal Abundance and Distribution?

In the last few weeks, Santa Barbara has seen an unprecedented number of marine mammals washing up on their shores. Previous research has suggested that a particular algal species is responsible, Pseudo-nitzschia. This particular species produces domoic acid, a neurotoxin that causes seizures, brain damage and death in marine mammal. These blooms can be greatly enhanced by run off, eutrophication, and El Nino cycling where strong upwelling years foster bloom all of which are occurring right now in Santa Barbara. These reports have also been documented in coastal waters along the West Coast, Gulf of Mexico, and in the Gulf of Maine affecting all animals of the food web.

The motivation for this study was formed from the questions surrounding these blooms. What is causing them? Can we predict when they will occur next? Can we prevent them? What conditions allow this species to thrive?

## Data Wrangling 

### Algae Data

Grouping by organism and filtering for the toxic algae Pseudo nitzschia and specific location will also be filtered for "Stearns Wharf".

```{r}
names_algae <- algal_occurence %>%
  group_by(organismName) %>% #grouping by organism name
  na.omit() #omitting na

pseudo_algae <- algal_occurence %>%
  filter(organismName == "Pseudo_nitzschia_seriata_group") #filter for toxic algal species

join <- left_join(pseudo_algae, algal_events, by = "id") #left join algal_events into pseuo_algae by ID

join_stearns <- join %>%
  filter(locationID == "HABs-StearnsWharf") %>% #filter for location ID of Stearns Wharf in SB
  mutate(year = format(eventDate, "%Y")) #Create a year column by extracting it from eventDate variable

```



### SST Data

Filtering for data between the years 2007 and 2022 as well as for "SITE1" Stearns Wharf

```{r}
sst_filter <- sst %>%
  mutate(year = format(date, "%Y")) #adds a new column named year to the sst dataframe by extracting the year value from date 

updated_sst <- sst_filter %>% #creates a new df filtering only rows where year column is greater than or equal to 2007 and less than or equal to 2022
  filter(year >= 2007 & year <= 2022)

sst_filter <- sst_filter %>%
  mutate(index = as.Date(date)) #adds a new column, index, which is created by converting the date column to a date object

sst_filter <- na.omit(sst_filter) #omits na

sst_filter <- sst_filter %>%
  arrange(index) #sorts dataframe by index column

sst_filter <- sst_filter %>%
  mutate(index = as.Date(date),
         temp = as.numeric(temp)) #converting temp column to numeric

#Repeats steps but for SITE1 exlusively 
sst_site1 <- sst_filter %>%
  filter(site == "SITE1") #filtering for SITE1 (Stearns Warf)

sst_filter1 <- sst_site1 %>%
  mutate(index = as.Date(date))  #adds a new column, index, which is creaed by converting date column to a date object

sst_filter1 <- na.omit(sst_filter1) #omits na

sst_filter <- sst_filter1 %>%
  arrange(index) #sorts df by index column

sst_filter1 <- sst_filter1 %>%
  mutate(index = as.Date(date),
         temp = as.numeric(temp)) #converting temp into a numeric
```

## Joining Data

```{r}
date_join_stearns <- left_join(join_stearns, updated_sst, by ="year") #join into join_stearns by id

join <- join[complete.cases(join$decimalLatitude, join$decimalLongitude), ] #filters rows in join dataframe whre both lat and long are not missing
join_sf <- st_as_sf(join, coords = c("decimalLatitude", "decimalLongitude"), crs = 4326) #converts join df into a spatial feature and uses crs 4326

date_join_stearns <- date_join_stearns %>%
  mutate(y_m = yearmonth(date)) %>% #adds a y_m columm representing year and month of the date column 
  filter(!is.na(date)) #filters out rows where date is not missing 

```

## Data Exploration

### Plotting Temp and Date Relationship

```{r}
linear_model <- lm(temp ~ date, data = updated_sst) #fits a linear model
slope <- coef(linear_model)[2] #extracts slope coefficient for data variable from linear model 

#we've all see this general trend, showing seasonal oscillations
ggplot(data = updated_sst, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "#726161", size = 0.25) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") + #adds a treadline to plot using linear model 
  labs(x = "Time", 
       y = "Sea Surface Temperature (°C)") + 
  ggtitle("Sea Surface Temperature Trend Over the Last 15 Years")
```

Sea surface temperature over the last 15 years shows a prominent trend. There's clear seasonality and a steady upward trend likely to continue in the following years.

## Statistical Analysis 

H0: Seasonality does affect algal bloom abundance and distribution

HA: Seasonality does not affect algal bloom abundance and Distribution

### Linear Regression

```{r}
summary(lm(temp ~ date, data = sst_filter))
```

A p-value of 2.2×10−162.2×10−16 is extremely small and essentially zero. In statistical hypothesis testing, a common significance level (alpha) is 0.05. If the p-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is typically rejected, suggesting that there is evidence to support the alternative hypothesis. In this case, with a p-value much smaller than 0.05 (specifically, 2.2×10−162.2×10−16), it indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis. You would generally conclude that there is a statistically significant relationship between the independent variable(s) in your linear regression model and the dependent variable but this value and the coefficients don't correlate to the rrange of this data.

In summary, based on the p-value provided we can reject null hypothesis, supporting the idea that there is a statistically significant relationship in the linear regression model. Unfortunately, due to how small the p-value is it should cause pause.

### Decomposition

Isolating each component of the time series visually and quantitatively

```{r}
decomp_stearn <- date_join_stearns %>%
  filter(!is.na(date)) %>%  #filters out where date is not missing
  mutate(y_m = yearmonth(date)) %>% #add a new column y_m representing year and month from date column
  group_by(y_m) %>% #groups data by year and month
  summarise(total_quant = sum(organismQuantity, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% #calculates total quantity of organism for each group ignoring missing values
  mutate(total_quant = na.approx(total_quant)) %>% #interpolates missing values in total_quant column
  as_tsibble(index = y_m) #converts data to a tsibble
```

```{r}
decomp_stearn %>% model( #specifies the STL decomposition time series model 
    STL(total_quant)
  ) %>%
  components() %>% #extracts components (trend, seasonality, and remainder) from decomposition
  autoplot() + #creates a visualization
  labs(title = "Stearns Warf, Santa Barbara")
```

\*Data ends in 2022 so we can only infer what the trend looks like as it approaches 2024

In 2015, the US west coast suffered the worst, on record, domoic event and this is evident in the prominent spike shown in this graph at the 2015 time stamp. This suggests a correlation between organism quantity and time of year. This graph also shows clear seasonality with a peculiar increase in magnitude of the season_year oscillations after 2015. It should also be noted that the residuals show a general trend which suggests that there are other drivers to this analysis that aren't accounted for. Finally, after examining the size of the grey bars, the long run trend and the residuals appear to be important in driving the overall variation in algae count.

## Multiple Linear Regression

```{r}
date_join_stearns <- date_join_stearns %>%
  mutate(year = format(y_m, "%Y")) #extracts year from y_m  column

mod <- lm(organismQuantity ~ temp + year, data = date_join_stearns) #fits a linear regression model where organism quantity is dependent and temp and year are independent variables 
summary(mod) #summary statistics
```

The p-value remains the same and the coefficients again don't make much sense in terms of the data making it difficult to accept or reject the null.

## Autocorrelation

In order to extract insights into seasonality and periodicity in time series data, Autocorrelation works well. Interpretation of the ACF plot involves examining the heights and patterns of the bars or spikes. The bars that extend beyond the shaded region indicate statistically significant correlations. Interpretation of this provides a graphical representation of how the values of a time series are correlated with their own past values at different lags. By specifying **`lag.max = 52`**, it constructs an autocorrelation up to a lag of 52 time points.

```{r}
acf(decomp_stearn$total_quant, lag.max=52) 
```

To assess the nature of seasonality, a 52 week annual window of time was used. This autocorrelation shows values close to 1 (such as lag 1) showing strong positive correlation with past values. There is also evident toughs and peaks representing a repeating pattern and seasonality as well as statistically significant values concluding that the observed correlations are unlikely due to random chance.

## Findings

Although this study shows seasonal trends between temperature and time over the last 15 years, the linear regression models that were run don't provide sufficient p-values or coefficients to confidently accept the null that seasonality does in fact affect algal bloom abundance and distribution. Further analysis is required.
